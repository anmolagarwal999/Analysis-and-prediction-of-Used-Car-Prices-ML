    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>The aim is here to develop a ML model hat predicts the price of used cars based on its features, in order to make
        informed purchases. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of sale prices of different makes and models
        across cities in India between the years <b>1998 and 2019</b>.The features available in the training dataset
        were <b> Mileage, Make, Model, Year, kms travelled,transmisson, fuel type and City</b>.The model is not flawless
        but in most cases, it does a decent job of predicting an approximate value of the cars selling price in current Indian market.</p>

    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>When shopping for a used vehicle, typically an overriding concern is: Am I paying too much? This question is
        often difficult to answer due to the fact that it's hard to keep track of all the vehicles of interest currently
        available on the market.<br>Deciding if a used car is worth the cost put by the seller is a difficult task. Even
        for
        the seller, it is a challenge to decide the selling price of a car as it should neither be too low so as to
        cause a loss, nor too high that it puts off potential customers. Several factors including make,model,year,kms
        driven etc can affect the actual worth of a car. The motivation of this project is to help predict correct worth
        of used cars.</p>
    <h4>Random Forest
    </h4>
    <p>Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm. The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees,
        usually trained with the “bagging” method. The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of
        learning models increases the overall result.</p>
    <h4>Final Conclusions
    </h4>
    <p>Like most data science problems, this work would have undoubtedly benefitted from cleaner (and more) data. While
        the details provided in the downloaded listings are quite comprehensive,some features, especially 'name',seemed
        to have too many variations with even the same car model having multiple sub-categories.</p>
